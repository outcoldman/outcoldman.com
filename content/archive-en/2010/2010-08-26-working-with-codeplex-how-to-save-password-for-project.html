title: Working with CodePlex. How to save password for project?

<p>I want to make public one small project on CodePlex. Everybody knows that you can work with CodePlex like with TFS client and with SVN client as well. But really I can’t work with it from SVN client. When I tried to add some binary file (it was dll) I got the error “Server sent unexpected return value (200 OK) in response to PUT request for …”. How to solve this problem I don’t know, I found thread at CodePlex's discussions <a href="http://codeplex.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=67527">Can't commit binary files using TortoiseSVN</a>, but last message was at past year. Ok, I’m working with TFS at work, so for me it will be not a problem connect to CodePlex with TFS. But there are some distressing case, Visual Studio always ask credentials at every new connection to project. And I didn’t find a checkbox “Save credentials”. But I found the method. </p>

<p>I did it in my Windows 7. Go to the <i>Control Panel</i>, next <i>User Accounts and Family Safely</i>, then <i>User Accounts</i>. At the left pane looking <i>Credential Manager</i>:</p>

<p>Choose <i>Add a Windows credential</i>:</p>

<p>And put your right credentials for CodePlex’s TFS:</p>

<p>Where you safe your source code? Github, Google Code? Only me suffer from CodePlex? :)</p>
