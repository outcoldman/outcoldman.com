Unofficial Google Music player for Windows 8. Application has been listed on the
first place of top paid applications for several days. Version 3.0 got very
high ratings. More than 1000 everyday users. Closed it for several reasons, one of them
was the problems with supporting not documented API.

Open source Google Chrome application for managing bookmarks. I've built first

offered me a help for building next version, which we renamed into Dewey.
Application has more than 1500 everyday users. I always considered it just as
fun project so never tried to spend a lot of time on it.
