There is some drama for you, my dear reader.

It was a regular day. I was skiing with my skydiver friends when I received that email. At first, I thought this 
was one of those emails, you know, we can do SEO for you, build apps, hire you, promote you, teach you. 

But not, this 
was a personal email that I have never received before. A person, claiming himself to be a Mac AppStore vigilantes 
or a security researcher, told me that they found an abusive behavior in my application. So I took it seriously.

Ok, I can give you some respect for that. You seem a little arrogant, but if you do, what you claim to do, maybe 
you can help developers and users, with issues reported in this article [Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/)

You suggested googling your alias. I did. I could not find anything. Yes, only one tweet about finding one app 
was stealing user data. I am sure there are many more. Keep doing what you are doing.

A.I.? Seriously? You probably heard this joke, right?

{{< tweet 1065778379612282885 >}}

Ok, you can call it an A.I., I will call it a script.

It is simple. Be respectful of your users. Give them access to you, don’t hide under aliases. Publish your applications 
in places where it is allowed: ProductHunt, relative subreddits, and any communities that will find it useful. Ok, 
I admit, one community banned me for self-promoting. They have strict rules about that, I forgot. If you have an 
email where users can write, you can talk to them, hear feedback, discover bugs, and fix them.

ProductHunt rated the app [pretty well](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/openin-app). 
Some users on Reddit found my app pretty useful.

Also, I am a hard worker. If users say something does not work, I go and fix it. Send them a reply that the issue is 
resolved and always add a note that the best way to support the app is written review. Some users happily write it.

Should I be sorry for that? Should I tell my users to please check other reviews and make sure that yours will not be similar?

I know nothing about Black SEO. But have you tried to look at the app? Maybe there are some things that relative to Google Chrome?
I feel like you suggested using Google before. Have you tried it yourself?

Please do. Maybe your little script can boost my app downloads? Also, App Store connect is not really useful. 
Please tell me when my app will get to the Top 200 apps.

Good, I don't really want to hear from you again. Unless you keep me posting on some stats you can get out of the App Store.

Ok... bud... That is low. I just looked at Twitter, and it seems like you are from Germany... Are we playing a game? 
Who can say mean things about each other? Just a note, I am U.S. Citizen, originally from Russia. 
Should I call you an N-word for being from Germany?

I don't really think you do.

Good luck to you too, bud. Just a few suggestions for you.

At first, If you want to keep calling yourself a researcher,
please do some research before accusing anybody of anything. At first, use Google, try to find out about this person. 
Maybe you can find many articles, discussions on various forums, public talks, public profiles in social networks, 
work history, and some other projects or companies built by that person.

Second, think before you write.

And the last, fix some bugs in your `script_ai.py`. 

Sincerely yours, Russian Spy.
