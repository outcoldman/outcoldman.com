There is some drama for you, my dear reader.

It was a regular day. I was skiing with my skydiver friends when I received that email. At first, I thought this 
was one of those emails, you know, we can do SEO for you, build apps, hire you, promote you, teach you. 

But no, this 
was a personal email that I have never received before. A person, claiming to be a Mac AppStore vigilante 
or a security researcher, told me that they found an abusive behavior in my application. So I took it seriously.

Ok, I can give you some respect for that. You seem a little arrogant, but if you do what you claim to do, maybe 
you can help developers and users with issues reported in this article [Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/)

You suggested googling your alias. I did. I could not find anything. Yes, only one tweet about finding one app 
was stealing user data. I am sure there are many more. Keep doing what you are doing.

A.I.? Seriously? You probably heard this joke, right?

Ok, you can call it an A.I., I will call it a script.

It is simple. Be respectful of your users. Give them access to you, donâ€™t hide under aliases. Publish your applications 
in places where it is allowed: ProductHunt, relative subreddits, and any communities that will find it useful. If you
have an email where users can write, you can talk to them, hear feedback, discover bugs, and fix them.

ProductHunt rated the app [pretty well](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/openin-app). 
Some users on Reddit found my app pretty useful.

Also, I am a hard worker. If users say something does not work, I go and fix it. Send them a reply that the issue is 
resolved and always add a note that the best way to support the app is written review. Some users happily write it.

Should I be sorry for that? Should I tell my users to please check other reviews and make sure that yours will not be similar?

I know nothing about Black SEO. But have you tried to look at the app? Maybe there are some things that relative to Google Chrome?
I feel like you suggested using Google before. Have you tried it yourself?

Please do. Maybe your little script can boost my app downloads? Also, App Store connect is not really useful. 
Please tell me when my app will get to the Top 200 apps.

Good, I don't really want to hear from you again. Unless you want to keep me posted on some stats you can get out of the App Store.

Ok... bud... That is low. I just looked at Twitter, and it seems like you are from Germany... Are we playing a game? 
Who can say mean things about each other? Not that it should matter, but I am U.S. Citizen, originally from Russia.
History of the nation, location or ethnicity should not define the person, right?

I don't really think you do.

Good luck to you too, bud. Just a few suggestions for you.

First, If you want to keep calling yourself a researcher,
please do some research before firing off random half baked accusation. Maybe try using Google, 
find out about the person. 
Maybe you can find many articles, discussions on various forums, public talks, public profiles in social networks, 
work history, and some other projects or companies built by that person.

Second, think before you write.

And the last, fix some bugs in your `script_ai.py`. 

Sincerely yours, Russian Spy. 

P.S. Today was a happy day, my app was accepted in the SetApp store, and I keep getting positive reviews,
feedback and feature suggestions! If you are interested, check it out [loshadki.app/openin](https://loshadki.app/openin/).
