title: Moving to Jekyll
slug: "jekyll"
---

I finally did it. I found some time to get rid of my old custom-made `ASP.NET` blog and move all my content to static web site powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). If I remember it right this is my third move. I started my blogging "career" at GotDotNet (it was old-Russian-only blog/forums website about .NET development). After some time I decided that I want to have my own place with only my blog posts and so I started to write on LiveJournal. Not the best choice, so after some time I built my own webblog powered with `ASP.NET 2.0` which I used until yesterday. It worked really well for these 4 years, but it was too old and a little bit ugly. 

I was looking on the various options where I can go next. Of course I could continue to support my own custom made blog, I could add Markdown and fix some `CSS/HTML`. And to be honest I actually already did that partially. 

While I was doing that I made decision that it should store all my content as simple `markdown`/`html`, so I will not need to use any Databases and simplify deployment of new entries in my blog. Also I wanted to be able to run it under `Linux`/`Windows`/`MacOS` (Mono also works). This is where I decided that I actually need to take a look around to find out what people are using in `.NET`/`Node.js` worlds (this is where I am right now). This is where I found that even `.NET` guy from GitHub [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com) (I guess the only one `.NET` guy in this company) is using `Jekyll`. More than that his web site is [open sourced](https://github.com/Haacked/haacked.com) under MIT License, so you can use it as a tutorial to build your own Jekyll-based web site (or even fork it). And so I decided to try Jekyll as well. 

I also spent some time trying to find some good `node.js` alternatives. There are a lot of them, like [docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad), [wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) or [hexo](https://github.com/tommy351/hexo), they are all good, but in summary they have less forks than Jekyll. This  means a lot.

There are couple of things I've learned while I was doing all that `Jekyll` + `Disqus`. If you are going to do the same soon - it can be useful for you as well.

## Jekyll and GitHub pages

* Jekyll is very easy to setup. Install it with `gem` using [Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/). Don't try to install [github-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) - I don't see why you may need it, and it is not so easy to install because of some dependencies on native libraries. 
* If you are going to host your blog on GitHub pages - start exploring Jekyll plugins form the [list](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages) of officially supported by GitHub plugins. I started my learning from [Jekyll's Plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) page and ended up with `AliasGenerator` which is not supported by GitHub. Not a big issue, because I still can commit all of the auto generated by `AliasGenerator` pages (this is the beauty of static websites).
* All of the projects on GitHub get default entries in pattern like `username.github.io/project-name`, except one which is named like `username.github.io`, it will be hosted under root of `http://username.github.io`. Not having virtual paths in web-site root helps you to have absolute urls like `/`.

## Disqus 

Disqus is the worst of the best. I mean you cannot find better service for commentaries, but this one does not support Markdown and custom themes. I even tried to build my own on [NodeKnockout](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/outcold) (I believe demo site does not work anymore), but just did not have a time to complete it after. 

There are some things which can help you with importing your old commentaries to Disqus:

* If you have your own format of commentaries you can prepare them with [special XML format](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150) which Disqus understands.
* I did not know that you can [upload](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/912757) at first the list of all threads you already have. So I ended up with executing JavaScript which opens all existing pages, so they will force Disqus to create thread for each of them. 
* If you have IDs in commentaries and you specify them in `wp:comment_id` - don't afraid to upload the same commentary more than once. Disqus smart enough to match them, so you will not have duplicates.
* Cyrillic is a pain. Disqus stores URLs in encoded form, so if you are using special symbols or non-ASCII characters you will get something like `%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%CC%86` instead of `Коварный` in URL. It can be a pain, because some characters can be encoded differently by different frameworks/languages. For example Russian character `й` can be encoded like character `й` (`%D0%B9`) or with `и` (`%D0%B8`) and one of the [Combining character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character) `%CC%86`. Just be aware about that.

## Attribution to open source

* Having [Phil Haack](https://github.com/Haacked)'s [open sourced blog](https://github.com/Haacked/haacked.com) was very helpful. Also I used it as an inspiration for my own design. As you can see it is the same design, but completely different `CSS`. I also decided to keep my theme under MIT license.
* [Bower](http://bower.io) - the easiest way to keep all the client references up to date.
* [HighlightJS](http://highlightjs.org) - best of the best for source code highlighting.
* [normalize-css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - I verified how my site looks only in Chrome and Safari. Hope that because of `normalize.css` it should look the same in all other browsers.
* [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) - the best set of icons you can get on the web.
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [jekyll\_alias\_generator](https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator).
* [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) font - good combination with `Georgia`.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) - JavaScript task runner.
