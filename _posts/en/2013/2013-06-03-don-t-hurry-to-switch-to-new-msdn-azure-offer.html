<p>The most important thing which I learned after I moved to USA – always read License Agreements ;) New MSDN Azure subscription offer is awesome for you if you are developing a lot on Azure and you subscribed to a lot of Azure services. In this case you cannot use your MSDN benefits to cover all your needs, so you can use them only to cover some of your dev/test needs. 
</p><p>But in case like I have this offer does not work so well. I use Azure mostly for trying things and host my small projects (one of which this website). All my small projects are shared web sites, you can take a look on the estimated prices for shared web site on this page <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/web-sites/">Web Sites (Preview)</a>. It is about $10 per month if you are using 744 hours per month. From last month usage details I found that I use about 150-200 hours/month and about 2-3Gb of Data Transferring (<a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/data-transfers/">first 5Gb are free</a>), so it will cost me about $3. You can get access to this statistics on your <a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions">subscriptions page</a> (click on your active subscription and use "Download usage details" link on sidebar). 
</p><p>But can I use new benefits to cover this $3? No. Check <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/">MSDN benefits page</a> (FAQ part):

	</p><p>Could I use MSDN benefits for production before? Yes:

	</p><p>So, choice is yours. I chose to stay with old offer for next year (until 1st August). You can do the same on page with your <a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p>
